                                <p>On 19th century primitives settlers of this area were Aetas characterized by small, curly black hair and their attitude were far from that of the Dabaweño tribe, they were nomadic people. They were barefooted. Men only wore “bahag” while women used to drape only the lower portion of their bodies and their children wore no clothes. It was their culture that women go on farming for their food while men just carry their bow and arrow to fight their enemies. They ate camote for food with seafoods they got from fishing.</p>

It was also in this year that Roman Cabaluna came to this place. The first primary school was erected at the lot of Helario dela Peña in small Panabo.

In the middle of the year 1944, the Japanese Imperial Government issued a memorandum that set up the Philippine Government and appointed Jose P. Laurel as the President. From the period of 1942 to 1944 brought a normal life to the barangay folks. A chapel was constructed through the leadership of Paterno Obeso. They celebrate their feast every 3rd day of October in honor of Sta. Teresita as their patron saint.Then, two Japanese came to reside the area; they were Sud Ging San who established Mallorca Factory. They produced “tuba” from coconut while Naka Sero San manufactured dynamites. On October 1945, American reclaimed the Filipino from Japanese invasion. They set up a Philippine government, appointed Sergio Osmeña Sr. and declared the Philippine Independence on July 04, 1946. Panabo became a municipality on July 19, 1949. Lucio Verdida, being the Vice Mayor of Tagum and who happened to be a resident of Cagangohan, was automatically appointed as the municipal mayor. Unfortunately, Mr. Roman Cabaluna, who was also a resident of Km. 30 Crossing National Hi-way, Cagangohan won on the following election but was not able to complete his term of service because he died. Santa Teresita Chapel was destroyed during the war.<br/><br/>
                            In 1947, Marcelina Resma, Tomasa Palayao and Marcela Alforque, all coming from Minglanilla, Cebu agreed to construct another chapel with Corazon de Maria as patron saint celebrating its feast every 22nd day of August. In 1950 which is presently Purok Kaimito and Purok Avocado, Reynaldo Medalla, initiated to construct another chapel in km. 31 which they honored San Isidro Labrador and celebrate its feast on the 15th of May. Cagangohan was officially declared as a regular barrio on July 1, 1949 through Executive Order 236 with Arnulfo Valmores from Talibon, Bohol as the tenyente del barrio.</p>

                            <p class="panel-body">Ignacio Devilleres became the next tenyente del barrio after Arnulfo Valmores. The first school was put up on the warehouse of Yap Duan and the first teacher was Mr. Mariano Berido. A year later, the school was moved to the lot of Bacaran Moro and the teachers were Mr. Mulat a Boholano and Mr. Teczon an Ilonggo. Many times the school was moved from one place to another because no one donated for its site. Until 1960, when a certain Glecerio L. Dondoy who married one Cagangohan lass, donated a one hectare lot for the school site thus the construction of Cagangohan Primary now Dondoy Elementary School became a reality. This time, Francisco Demeterio was the tenyente del barrio. He was then replaced by Jovencio Mosqueda. Jeep and “Kalesa” were used as transportation in the barangay. Barangay folks enjoyed the affordability of the basic commodities. Sabas Enguito from Oroquieta, Misamis Occidental succeeded Jovencio Mosqueda as tenyente del barrio. He carried his position well.The place was relatively peaceful but illegal dynamite fishing and poisoning resulted to reduction of marine life.<br/><br/>
                            The election on 1971 placed Ricardo Verallo in the position of tenyente del barrio. Martial Law was declared on 1972 by the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos. Tenyente del Barrio was changed to barrio captain.</p>
